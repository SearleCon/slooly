# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    notes:
     invoices:
      due_date: '<strong>Due Date:</strong> The due date is important. It is what drives the reminder emails. The "DAYS FOR PRE-DUE REMINDER" and "DAYS BETWEEN REMINDER EMAILS" in your settings will be subtracted or added respectively to the Due Date. <strong><em>Example:</em></strong> If your due date is <strong>today</strong>, the first overdue reminder will be <strong>today plus 7 days</strong>(Default in settings is 7 - You can change this if you want). In this case, the Pre-Due reminder date will be set to <strong>today less 2</strong>(Default in Settings is 2 - You can also change this to suit your needs).'
      status: '<strong>Status:</strong> The default status is "Chasing". Leave it as this in order to set this newly added invoice to be chased. If you are editing an invoice, changing it to anything other than "Chasing", will STOP the reminder emails from being sent for this invoice. "Delete" will mark it as deleted, but will not in fact delete it from the database. To delete the invoice permanently, click the delete link for that invoice on the invoice listing screen. Selecting "Send Final Demand" will set this to send the final demand letter to the client. Please note that it will send it the NEXT day, along with the daily reminder email run, in order to give you the chance to stop it from being sent, if need be.'
      description: '<strong>Description:</strong> This is for your records only, and will not display on any reminder emails.'
      settings: '<strong>Settings:</strong> Your settings are extremely important part of how the application works. Before loading any invoices, make sure to check and customize them to suit your needs (This is done only once), including the following items:<br><br> 1. Your banking and payment details <br> 2. Your reminder email subject and message.'
      old_invoices: '<strong>Loading OLD invoices:</strong> If you are loading an invoice that is very old, and way overdue, we recommend that you load them into Paying Mantis with a due date of YESTERDAY. This will ensure that a "pre-due" and "due" reminders are not sent (because obviously for these slow paying clients, it has already passed). It will also make sure that the chain of overdue reminders sent will start at the first one, and go through the entire process, yielding the best possible results for payment.'
     clients:
      email: '<strong>Email:</strong> The clients email address is the most important item on this page. Make sure to enter it correctly, as all the reminder emails will be sent to this address.'
      other: '<strong>Other:</strong> The Business name, Contact Person, Address, City and Post code will appear on the reminder email for the client.'
     settings:
      send_from_name: '<strong>Send From Name:</strong> This name will be used at the end of the reminder email.'
      email_copy_to: '<strong>Email Copy To:</strong> A copy of the reminder emails will be sent to this email address as well as the clients (For example, send a copy to yourself, or your credit control clerk for your records etc. (The client will not see this email address))'
      days_between_chase: '<strong>Days Between Chase:</strong> The number of days between the reminder emails (Default starts 7 days from the due date)'
      days_before_pre_due: '<strong>Days Before Pre-Due:</strong> The number of days before the due date that the pre-due reminder email will be sent (Default is 2 days before the due date)'
      payment_method_message: '<strong>Payment Method Message:</strong> This will appear on the bottom of your reminder emails, and it is very important to make sure your correct banking details and other payment methods are displayed here, as it is what the client will use to make the payment.'
