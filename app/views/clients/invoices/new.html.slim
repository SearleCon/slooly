In this case, the Pre-Due reminder date will be set to <strong>today less 2</strong>(Default in Settings is 2 - You can also change this to suit your needs).")

To delete the invoice permanently, click the delete link for that invoice on the invoice listing screen. Selecting <em>Send Final Demand</em> will set this to send the final demand letter to the client. Please note that it will send it the NEXT day, along with the daily reminder email run, in order to give you the chance to stop it from being sent, if need be.")

It will also make sure that the chain of overdue reminders sent will start at the first one, and go through the entire process, yielding the best possible results for payment.")
